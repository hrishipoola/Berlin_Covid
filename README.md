# Berlin_Covid

On October 20, 2020, Berlin registered 822 new covid cases, the highest single day increase since the start of the pandemic. Let's break out and visualize how the new case rise looks like by district. We'll access data from Berlin.de (https://daten.berlin.de/datensaetze/covid-19-berlin-verteilung-den-bezirken), which features cumulative data by district current up to October 19, 2020. Since it's not quite in the shape we need it to be, we'll clean it up by splitting columns, applying regex, dropping columns, and changing data types. We'll create quick bar chart by district. To map the districts, we'll convert a Berlin geojson (https://data.technologiestiftung-berlin.de/dataset/bezirksgrenzen) into a districts dataframe and create a choropleth map using folium. We see that Mitte, Neukolln, and Tempelhof-Schoneberg have the highest number of new cases. The purpose of this is to visualize Berlin's current covid landscape by district.
